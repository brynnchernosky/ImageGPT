README

Model is based on ImageGPT from "Generative Pretraining from Pixels"

Data used is CIFAR-10 python dataset retrieved through
    Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/pankrzysiu/cifar10-python


Sampling
- Performance on predicting the entire second half of the image was quite poor,
    so we instead decided to try predicting the last fourth of the image.

Environment requirements:
    pytorch, huggingface, transformers, comet_ml

To train/save/test:
    python3 image-gpt.py -sTt data/data_batch_1 data/data_batch_2 data/data_batch_3 data/data_batch_4 data/data_batch_5

To load/sample:
    python3 image-gpt.py -lS data/data_batch_1 data/data_batch_2 data/data_batch_3 data/data_batch_4 data/data_batch_5
